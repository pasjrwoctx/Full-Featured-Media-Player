# Full-Featured-Media-Player

I was trying to create a Full Featured Media Player for wordpress, I wanted it to access already uploaded audio and video media files without having to re-upload, I also wanted it to have a full back end where the admin could create playlists, and short codes for those playlists, I want to prevent all downloads from the player, I wanted a pretty futuristic skin that would be responsive to what ever theme and layout was being used, on the front end, I wanted all the normal, Play, Pause, Stop FF-RV Shuffle as to shuffle songs on loaded play list, I also wanted a waveform displayed as the audio files played, along with showing title an next in cue, as I honestly have no clue what I am doing, as none, this is as far as I got and it well does nothing. If you can make it alll work as I have described give it a go and I will see if it is what I wanted.
